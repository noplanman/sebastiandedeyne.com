Hi,

Mark your calendars! Next week I'm giving a talk about Vite at the [Laravel Worldwide Meetup](https://meetup.laravel.com). The meetup starts at 20:00 CET (that's 2021-04-27T18:00:00Z).

I'll dive into how bundlers like Vite and Webpack differ, and move on to a practical guide on how to install Vite in a Laravel app. The Laravel Worldwide Meetup is hosted by Freek, and Kai Sassnowski will also give a talk about database indexing.

See you then!

## Everyday writing

A few weeks back I set up a recurring task in Things: write 280 characters. Every day, I try to write at least 280 characters. This can be anything: a few paragraphs on my blog, some notes from an article I read, a recap of something I did at work,â€¦ 

Writing 280 characters doesn't sound like much, but doing it every day *really adds up.* I don't think I've ever blogged as frequently as this month. The thing is, once I get those first few characters down, I often keep going until I've cleared by mind.

[Kai Sassnowski](https://twitter.com/warsh33p/status/1381529884611186688) has been talking about this a lot as he's writing a book.

> I cannot stress enough how important consistency is to getting things done. You don't have to work in crazy 14 hour bursts. 
> 
> Chip away at it. Every. Single. Day. Even if it's just two minutes.
> 
> *Anything* is better than doing nothing. And it really adds up fast.

## On the horizon

Write a Laravel package to easily self-host Google fonts. Typeset [Event Sourcing in Laravel](https://event-sourcing-laravel.com). Transfer my Vite talk from my mind to a presentation. Procrastinate and redesign my blog again instead. Read Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential. Listen to the latest [Spatie playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0rw7PsTmtm8PEfsF63lsF0?si=HgHLlZosT9aX5oIjdEZ_NQ) named after my new car. 

Until the next issue,

Seb
